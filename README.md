# Video Game Sales Prediction Project

## Problem Statement
For our project, we have decided to take an incisive look at the video game industry, focusing on the task of predicting future sales. Accurate sales forecasting is essential for developers, publishers, and marketers to make informed decisions about game development and marketing strategies. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts future video game sales based on historical data. Weâ€™ll analyze key factors such as genre, platform, region, release timing, along with economic conditions, to create a predictive model that provides valuable insights.

## Datasets Descriptions

### GDP Dataset

#### Overview
The GDP dataset provides annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for various countries over multiple years. The data is structured in a wide format, with each row representing a country and each column corresponding to a specific year.

#### Structure
- **Number of Entries**: 266
- **Columns**:
  - `Country Name`: Name of the country.
  - `Country Code`: Unique identifier for each country.
  - `Indicator Name`: Describes the economic indicator (GDP-related in this case).
  - `Indicator Code`: A code representing the indicator.
  - `Years (1960-2023)`: Annual GDP data for each year, represented as floating-point numbers. Some years may have missing data.

#### Usage
This dataset is used to identify the influence of GDP on video game sales. By analyzing GDP trends, we can explore the correlation between economic conditions and consumer spending on video games, which helps in making informed predictions about future sales trends.

### Population Dataset

#### Overview
The Population dataset provides population statistics for various countries over a range of years, similar in structure to the GDP dataset. The data is also in a wide format.

#### Structure
- **Number of Entries**: 306
- **Columns**:
  - `Country Name`: Name of the country.
  - `Country Code`: Unique identifier for each country.
  - `Indicator Name`: Describes the population-related indicator.
  - `Indicator Code`: A code corresponding to the indicator.
  - `Years (1960-2023)`: Annual population data for each year, represented as floating-point numbers. Some years may have missing data.

#### Usage
This dataset is used to analyze population demographics and their impact on video game sales. Specifically, it focuses on the 15-64 age group, which is considered the primary target audience for video games. By understanding population trends within this demographic, we can assess the potential market size and tailor sales predictions accordingly. This analysis helps in determining the influence of population dynamics on consumer demand for video games.

### Video Game Sales Dataset

#### Overview
The Video Game Sales dataset offers a comprehensive look at sales data for various video games across different platforms and regions. The data is structured in a long format with each row representing a game and its sales figures.

#### Structure

- **Columns**:
  - `Rank`: The rank of the game based on global sales.
  - `Name`: The title of the video game.
  - `Platform`: The gaming platform (e.g., Wii, NES).
  - `Year`: The year of release.
  - `Genre`: The genre of the video game (e.g., Sports, Platform, Racing).
  - `Publisher`: The company that published the game.
  - `NA_Sales`: Sales in North America (in millions).
  - `EU_Sales`: Sales in Europe (in millions).
  - `JP_Sales`: Sales in Japan (in millions).
  - `Other_Sales`: Sales in other regions (in millions).
  - `Global_Sales`: Total worldwide sales (in millions).

## Visualization and Data Analysis

#### Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly wordcloud
```

#### Usage

Various interactive visualizations are created to explore and analyze the distribution of sales across platforms, genres, and regions. Techniques such as bar charts, heatmaps, and word clouds are used to visualize the data.

#### Key Visualizations

- **Top-Selling Games**: A bar chart showing the top 10 best-selling video games globally.

- **Top-Selling Publishers**: A bar chart showing the top 10 best-selling video games publishers globally.

- **Sales by Genre**: A comparison of global sales across different game genres.

- **Platform Popularity**: A line chart displaying sales trends for major gaming platforms over the years.

-  **Word Cloud Ilustration**: A graphic illustration of the most popular words used for video games.

-  **Interactive pie charts**: Interactive pie charts visualize the top-selling video games based on different regional sales.

-  **Interactive histograms**: Visualize genre counts and sales according to platform.

-  **Boxplots**: The script utilizes several boxplots to analyze and visualize the distribution of video game sales across various dimensions, providing key insights into the data. These include boxplots that compare sales across different regions, genres, platforms, and release years. 

- **Regional Sales Distribution**: A heatmap illustrating the distribution of sales across North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions.


#### Statistical Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics such as mean, median, and mode are calculated for various sales columns. For instance, the mean global sales across all games, the median sales for specific platforms, and the standard deviation of sales across different genres are considered.

- **Range of Global Sales**: The global sales of video games have a wide range, from the minimum to a maximum value of 82.73 million units. This indicates significant variability in the success of video games, with a few titles achieving exceptional sales while most games have modest figures.

- **Variance and Standard Deviation of Global Sales**: The variance of 2.45 and standard deviation of 1.57 indicate that while there is variability in sales, most games cluster around the mean, with a few outliers driving the high range.

- **Interquartile Range (IQR) of Global Sales**: The IQR of 0.42 suggests that the middle 50% of games have global sales that are relatively close in value, highlighting that extreme sales figures are outliers.

The key statistical indicators are supported by visualizations and/or tables.

#### Findings

- **Genre Popularity**: The Sports genre dominates global sales, largely driven by titles like Wii Sports. Role-Playing and Platform games also perform strongly, particularly in Japan.

- **Platform Evolution**: The analysis shows the rise and fall of different gaming platforms over time, with platforms like the Wii, NES, and PlayStation series showing significant peaks in their respective eras.

- **Regional Preferences**: The data highlights the variation in gaming preferences across different regions. For example, Japan shows a stronger preference for Role-Playing games, while North America favors Action and Sports games.

- **Range of Global Sales**: The wide range of global sales, with a maximum of 82.73 million units, highlights the stark differences in success among video games. A small number of titles achieve extraordinarily high sales, while most games remain well below this peak.

- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: The variance (2.45) and standard deviation (1.57) further illustrate the spread of sales data, with most games clustering around a central value but with notable outliers that skew the distribution.
